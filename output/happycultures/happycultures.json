  "explanations": {
    "cut": "The happycultures protein powder received a 0% CUT score and was rejected because its leucine content (2.1g per serving) fell below the hard reject threshold of 2.2g. Despite having a good protein efficiency (19.7g protein/100 kcal) and protein percentage (72.8%), the insufficient leucine disqualifies it for cutting purposes, as leucine is crucial for preserving muscle mass during weight loss.",
    "bulk": "The \"happycultures\" protein powder received a low Bulk score (25%) primarily because of its low EAAs percentage (38.7%) and relatively low leucine content (2.1g), despite having a reasonable protein percentage (72.8%). While there were no hard rejects, the lower values in these key muscle-building amino acids significantly dragged down the overall score based on the BULK mode's weighting criteria. For someone bulking, this protein powder is less ideal due to the potentially insufficient levels of building blocks for muscle growth.",
    "clean": "The happycultures protein powder received a 0% CLEAN score and was rejected due to \"label_credibility_issues,\" implying inaccurate or misleading product information regardless of nutritional content. Even if the label was accurate, the low EAAs % (38.7%) for the stated protein content would likely result in a low CLEAN score, as optimizing for purity and amino acid quality are key priorities in this mode. Therefore, this product is not a good choice for someone prioritizing a clean and trustworthy protein source."
